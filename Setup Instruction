⚙️ Setup Instructions

Follow the steps below to set up and run the Lightweight DeepFake Detection System locally.

1️⃣ Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

Python 3.11 (recommended)

pip (Python package manager)

Git (optional, for cloning)

Check Python version:

python --version

2️⃣ Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Lightweight-DeepFake-Detection-Model.git
cd Lightweight-DeepFake-Detection-Model

3️⃣ Create a Virtual Environment
python -m venv .venv


Activate the virtual environment:

Windows

.venv\Scripts\activate


Linux / macOS

source .venv/bin/activate

4️⃣ Install Dependencies
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt

5️⃣ Train the Model (Quick Demo Training)

This step generates the trained model file.

python quick_train.py


After successful training, the model will be saved as:

models/deepfake_cnn.pth

6️⃣ Run the DeepFake Detection Web App
python src/inference/app.py


Open your browser and visit:

http://127.0.0.1:7860

7️⃣ Use the Application

Upload an image (or video frame)

The system will classify it as:

REAL ✅

FAKE ❌

UNCERTAIN 🤔 (low confidence)

🧪 Notes

The UNCERTAIN output is intentional and represents low model confidence.

This project uses a lightweight CNN trained on a small dataset for demonstration.

Accuracy can be improved with larger datasets and transfer learning.

🛑 Common Issues

ModuleNotFoundError → Ensure virtual environment is activated

Model not found → Run quick_train.py before inference

Always UNCERTAIN → Model confidence is low due to limited training data
