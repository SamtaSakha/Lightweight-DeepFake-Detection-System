# 📐 Mathematics Behind the Deepfake Detection Model

This project is built on core mathematical concepts from **linear algebra, probability, and optimization**, which together enable the CNN to distinguish between **real** and **fake** images.

## 1️⃣ Linear Algebra (Core of CNNs)

Images are represented as **multi-dimensional matrices (tensors)** of pixel values.

An RGB image is represented as:

\[
X \in \mathbb{R}^{H \times W \times 3}
\]

Where:
- \(H\) = height  
- \(W\) = width  
- \(3\) = RGB channels  

### Convolution Operation

Convolution applies learnable kernels to extract spatial features:

\[
(X * K)(i, j) = \sum_{m,n} X_{i+m,\,j+n} \cdot K_{m,n}
\]

This allows the model to extract features such as:
- edges
- textures
- facial artifacts (critical for deepfake detection)

## 2️⃣ Convolution & Pooling Operations

### Convolution Layers
- Perform weighted sums over local neighborhoods
- Capture local and hierarchical visual patterns

### Max Pooling

\[
y = \max(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n)
\]

Max pooling:
- Reduces spatial dimensions
- Makes the model invariant to small translations
- Lowers computational complexity

---

## 3️⃣ Non-Linear Activation (ReLU)

To introduce non-linearity, the **Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU)** is used:

\[
\text{ReLU}(x) = \max(0, x)
\]

This enables the network to:
- Learn complex visual representations
- Avoid vanishing gradient problems

---

## 4️⃣ Probability & Softmax Classification

The final fully connected layer outputs **logits**:

\[
z = [z_{\text{real}}, z_{\text{fake}}]
\]

These logits are converted into probabilities using the **Softmax function**:

\[
P(y_i) = \frac{e^{z_i}}{\sum_{j} e^{z_j}}
\]

This produces:
- \( P(\text{Real}) \)
- \( P(\text{Fake}) \)

---

## 5️⃣ Decision Threshold

The final prediction is made using probability thresholds:

- **Fake** if  
  \[
  P(\text{Fake}) > 0.7
  \]

- **Real** if  
  \[
  P(\text{Real}) > 0.7
  \]

- **Otherwise** → **Uncertain**
